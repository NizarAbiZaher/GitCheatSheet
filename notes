# GIT COMMANDS:

# Clone a repo: 
"git clone -SSH Key-" 

# Show ALL files (even hidden): 
"ls -la"

# Shows all files that were changed, updated, or deleted: 
"git status"

# Starts to track and add the new things you added that are untracked : 
"git add ."

# Commit the changes and code: 
"git commit -m"

# Push commit to GitHub & make it public in the repo: 
"git push origin master"

# Initialize new folder: 
"git init"

# To add to a place not on the computer: 
"git remote"

# To change where you want to automatically push changes: 
"git push -u origin master (whatever the name is)"

# Git branching is creating different 'branches' of code that may be a little different from the main one. it is good for companies and features as you don't need to change the principle. Each branch is doing its own thing, not knowing the other exists, unless you merge.

# To get the branch you are in:

"git branch"

# To switch between branches:

"git checkout master(or whatever name you have for the branch)"
# To make a new branch and go to it:

"git checkout -b feature(name whatever name you want)"

# To compare the code in different branches:

"git diff (name)"

# Standard way to commit to git and push changes to branch on github: 

"git checkout (name of branch)"
"git status"
"git push"
"git push -u origin (name of branch)"

# Pull request (PR) is where you pull code from one branch and bring it into another branch. Generally, you may do this on Github but pressing the yello button on top of your code. write a message and merge and press the pull request button. Then you can merge. The 'git pull' command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content:

"git pull"

# Delete branch (we usually do this once we have merged to the main branch):

"git branch -d (name of branch)"
